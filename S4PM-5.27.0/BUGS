S4PM Bug List
    
    o The multi-user mode feature is usable now, but should still be 
      considered BETA.

    o Browse file allocations - There is a minor bug whereby browse files
      (those of data type 'Browse') are allocated space in the disk pools but
      that space is not returned to the disk pools after the file no longer
      exists.

      Browse files are typically very small. Therefore, the best workaround
      is to assign a per file size of 1 byte per file and specify room in the
      disk pool for a large number, say 100,000. The Browse disk pool will
      slowly diminish one byte at a time, but if given a very large number
      in the first place, it should take a long time before it runs out of
      space. This is the current operational procedure at the GES DISC and
      it has been successful. The problem isn't noticed since full clean out
      of strings is done periodically.

      There *may* be a fix for this in the future.

    o Although the Data Mining Edition for S4PM has been folded formally into
      the S4PM baseline, it is new and there may be problems in deploying
      it. In addition, there is no available documentation yet.
